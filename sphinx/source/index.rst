TwoWay: ModelE Inputs
=====================

The *TwoWay* repository contains miscellaneous projects
to create ModelE input files; especially those related to elevation
classes or two-way ice sheet coupling.  This is not installed software; but rather, "workspace" software that is meant to be cloned form Git, and used in-place to generate the required files.

Each project lives in a separate folder, and could involve calling a
number of programs --- Python scripts, compiled code from other
software distributions, etc.  A hand-built *makefile* typically ties
everything together.
